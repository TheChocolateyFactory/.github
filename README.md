# üç´ TheChocolateyFactory

Welcome to **TheChocolateyFactory** ‚Äì your sweet spot for learning how to automate Chocolatey packaging with GitHub Actions! This is a demo organization used in workshops, demos, and talks to showcase how to build, test, and publish Chocolatey packages using modern CI/CD pipelines.

## üõ† What is This?

This organization is a mock factory that "produces" Chocolatey packages with the help of GitHub Actions. It's not real ‚Äì but the workflows, patterns, and packaging practices *are*. Think of this as your golden ticket to automating Windows package management.

## üéØ Goals

- üì¶ Demonstrate how to build and test Chocolatey packages
- ü§ñ Show how to use GitHub Actions to automate packaging workflows
- üöÄ Simulate publishing packages (without pushing to the real Chocolatey Community Repo)
- üß™ Explore testing techniques for package validation
- üß∞ Share templates and reusable actions for real-world use

## üìÅ Repositories

Each repo in this org serves a different purpose. A few highlights:

| Repository | Description      |
|------------|------------------|
| `wip`      | Work in progress |

> üí° Use this org as a reference or inspiration for your own automation pipelines.

## üöß Disclaimer

This is a demo org. No actual software is produced or distributed. All package names, tools, and brands used are for **educational purposes only**. Please don‚Äôt try to install anything unless you know what you‚Äôre doing!
